A dirty extension for adding compiz like windows transparency to gnome-shell.

I glued it together from what i could lern from google so don't expect anything
major, its simple, global window transparency.

If by any chance you know how to improve it, be my guest! jus share your code 
with the rest of us :)

* tested on gshell 3.8.2 (works fine)

HOW TO INSTALL:

A. Wait untill it passes a review at extensions.gnome3.org (that's gonna take a while)

B. Grab it from here:

- download and unpack
- make sure the folder is named 'transparentwindows@ellen' (gome-shell may not detect it
  if it has a difrent name)
- copy to  /home/USERNAME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
- restart shell (alt + f2 and type r than hit enter :) 
- simply enable it and enjoy transparent windows
